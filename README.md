# The Recipe Store -  Milestone 3 Project

![Site Image](https://github.com/StevePilcher/RecipeStoreMS3/blob/master/static/images/site-image.png)


This project was created for my Milestone 3 project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Dev course. The project requirements were to build a MongoDB-backed Flask project for a web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask and MongoDB.

The app I created is a single page site. I chose to create an online recipes store app which allows a user to be able to have an individual account for creating, editing and storing their own recipes. 

## Test User 
To showcase the app, a test user has been created with multiple recipes. Sign in with these credentials;

Username: Steve
Password: ABC 

## UX
 
The UX is a simple single page. A standard navbar which concatenates to a burger icon when in mobile view allows users to recognise the simple nav structure. The 'log in' & 'Sign Up' buttons are only visible when the user isn't logged in, otherwise a 'Log Out' button replaces them. The recipes are displayed in a masonary pattern across the page when screen width allows once retrieved from MongoDB.

Simple form structures clearly identify input fields for the user to create any recipes. 

### Typical User Stories

**New Chefs**

- Aspiring cooks arrive at the site and will be welcomed with the login screen. This login form also has a note for non registered users to 'sign up!' by clicking the link. 

- Once the new cook has signed up, because they are yet to have created a recipe to view they will be taken to the create recipe page. 

- The create recipe page is a simple form where all of the required fields have a heading explaining what is required to be entered. Once all of the data has been entered the user clicks the save button, which is also recognisable by the disk icon. The new recipe is saved and user redirected to all of their recipes which are saved.

- The log out button logs the user out of the session and redirects to a login screen.

**Existing Chefs**

- Existing chefs arrive at the site and will be welcomed with a login screen. 

- Once they have logged in the navbar includes 'create recipe' and 'search categories', they auto redirect to all of their saved recipes.  

- The user can scroll down their list of recipes and click on the edit icon attached to each recipe. This click redirects and populates the 'create recipe' form with the desired recipe alreay filled in for editing. The user can then edit and resave with the save button. 

- Alternitavely the user can click the bin icon to delete the recipe from their collection.

- The user can search for all recipes listed in under a certain category by clicking on the 'search categories' link from the navbar. This redirects the user to a page with 6 buttons, each identified for a recipe category. Once clicked the user retrieves all recipes within thier own collection with the same category.

- The log out button logs the user out of the session and redirects to a login screen.

## Features

### Existing Features
1. Main Page - Landing page with immediate login in form. Links in the nav bar for 'sign up' and 'log in' 

2. My Recipes - Displays a list of all user recipes saved in their collection, allows for editing and deletion of individual recipes.

3. Create Recipe -  A simple form to create individual recipes and save to their colleciton. 

4. Search Categories -  6 buttons that once the user is logged in will return all the recipes associated with that user and category.

5. Log Out - Log out button logs the user out of the session. 

### Features Left to Implement

1. Keyword search - Search bar that allows for individual recipes to be searched with any keyword rather than by category. Potential across all users recipes depending on GDPR. 

2. Images attachments - all image attachments to be store with recipes. 

3. Improved editing recipe features when in smaller screen sizes. Breadcrumbing each field as it's edited would be a better UX. This would require a complete overhaul of the current form submission function. 

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used;

- HTML5 
- CSS3
- Materialize (with integrated Javascript)
- JQUERY (for easier DOM manipulation)
- Python+Flask
- MongoDB

## Testing

### Web Browser Testing

The following Web Browsers were tested and no errors found;

- Mozilla FireFox Version 79.0
- Google Chrome Version 84.0.4147.105
- Microsoft Internet Explorer 11.329.19041.0 
- Microsoft Edge 44.19041.1.0

### Mobile Device 

Chrome Dev tools were used to simulate the following devices for testing;

- iPhone X 
- Pixel 2 & 2XL
- Samsung S10 Plus 
- Samsung Galaxy Tab (Portrait)
- iPad & iPad Pro

### Known Issues

- Masonary display effect can sometimes not render with larger gaps between grid items than desired. Especially when changing view dynamically to smaller screen sizes.

## Validators 

### W3C Markup Validator 

- 3 Warnings, 2 for lack of heading element used on sections (I feel headings are not required for UX), 1 for an h1 being used. 

### W3C CSS Validator 

- No errors or warnings were found on style.css
- 1 error associated with Materialize's minified css

### JSHint

- No errors were found after running JS through JShint

### PEP8online

- No errors were found after running python code through PEP8online. Result file can be found [here](https://github.com/StevePilcher/RecipeStoreMS3/blob/master/static/files/PEP8CheckCodeResults.txt)
 
## Testing Scenarios

    2. Page returns red error text under the input 'The username already exists'
    
6. Sign up page:
    1. User signs up with unique username and password 
    2. Form accepts and redirects to my recipes page

    2. Page redirects to the pre-filled in create form with requested recipe displayed for editing
